#given a log file we create a tractory, trajectory bestar av many small direction vectors that are describing the aruco markers movement towards the hand
#the live hand position is added to the direction vectors in the robot program, to tell the robot where to move
#the data has been converted to a uniform format and smoothed and filtered at this point

#matrix multiplication to find the directional vector

#do this for each points and frames

# spit out list of directional vectors
